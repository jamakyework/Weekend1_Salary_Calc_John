Weekend Project ReadMe
=======================

[x]  The application should first have an input form that collects the following:
    Employee First Name,
    Employee Last Name,
    ID Number,
    Job Title,
    Annual Salary,

[/]  A 'Submit' button should clear out the inputs and your logic should store
    that information.

[]  Then, that information should be appended to the DOM so
    the user of the application can see the information they just entered.

[]  Finally, your logic should calculate all of the employee salaries and report
    back the Monthly cost of  salaries.
    (use loop to calculate salaries, can use an alert or console log to report
    monthly cost of salaries)
